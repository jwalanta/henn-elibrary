# Folder structure

Data is `data` folder. See `yyyymmdd_template-folder` inside it for reference on how the folder and files should look like.

Each folder has a `README.md` file. See `yyyymmdd_template-folder\README.md` for reference on how the file should look like.

```
- data
  |- yyyymmdd-school-name-1
  |  |- docs
  |  |- photos
  |  README.md
  |- yyyymmdd-school-name-2
  |  |- docs
  |  |- photos
  |  README.md
```

# Static site generator

[TBD] - The goal is to use the information in the `data` folder and generate a static site that showcases the eLibraries.
